### v1.4.0 Price Limit
*2021/10/19*

#### New Option **Price Limit**

<img src="images/screenshots/price_limit.png" height="150"/>

Set a limit on how much hunt dollars you want to spend for your loadout.
The randomizer tries not to hit the price as much as possible, but to stay below it.

The pricetag is green if the loadout lands more than 10% below the limit, yellow if it's in the 10% and
red if it couldn't keep the limit.

#### Roadmap:

- Adding an option to avoid multiple melee tools

<img src="images/screenshots/screenshot_main_v1.3.jpg" width="200" height="150"/>
</p>

With **Hunt: Showdown Patch 1.5** Custom Ammunition was introduced to the game.

Single shot weapons and crossbows can use 2 ammo types at once.
Weapons with a magazine can only use one type.
There are different types for each weapon.

The **HuntShowdownLoadoutRandomizer** now adds this feature to the loadout generator.
Thus, in addition to the standard ammunition, you can also use the new ammunition types.

#### Known issues:
- The rank option is not working with custom ammo yet. (use rank 100)
- The constellation of weapons can be wrong if less than 5 weapons are selected in the settings.

**HuntShowdownLoadoutRandomizer** is a local browser application that generates random loadouts for the game Hunt: Showdown.
It is perfectly suited to be used as a browser plugin in OBS-Studio and similar applications and was made exactly for this purpose.

---

## Usage in OBS:
1. Download all files and store them in a local folder on your PC. (Download as .zip and unpack)
2. Add **Randomizer.html** as a **Browser** source with a local file to your scene in OBS.
It has been designed to work with the default resolution for browser resources in OBS of 800px x 600px or larger. 

To interact with the **Randomizer** in OBS, right-click on the **Browser** source and select *Interact*.

As default, OBS includes a custom CSS in all browser sources which looks as follows:

```body { background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); margin: 0px auto; overflow: hidden; }```

You can remove this line if you don't want the background of the randomizer to be transparent. Or add any other color, if you like.


## Using the Randomizer:
- **Go** - generates a random loadout based on the settings made.
- **Set** - in the settings menu you can make a selection about the items you want to generate. These can be filtered via the rank and the search line to ensure a quick search.
- **Rank** - the filter setting for the rank. Filters the item list to all possible items you can have in this rank.
- **Dual Chance** - this is the probability in percent that pistols will be equipped as dual weapons, if the loadout allows it.
- **Quartermaster** - sets whether you have the Quartermaster Trait.
- **First Aid Kit** - always includes a First Aid Kit in the tool selection.
- **Melee Weapon** - always includes a melee weapon in the tool selection.
